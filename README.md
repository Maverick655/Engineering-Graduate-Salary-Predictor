# Salary Prediction for Engineering Graduates using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Welcome to the Salary Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the salary of engineering graduates using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The project utilizes a dataset containing features such as GPA, college ranking, years of experience, etc., to predict the salary of engineering graduates.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the salary of engineering graduates based on their academic and professional qualifications. By training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on historical data, we aim to create a predictive model that can provide valuable insights into the salary expectations of engineering graduates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- GPA (Grade Point Average)
- College ranking (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- Major (e.g., Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering)
- Years of experience
- Internship experience (binary: yes/no)
- Technical skills (e.g., programming languages, software tools)
- etc.

The target variable is the salary of the engineering graduate.

## Techniques Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Utilizing the SVM algorithm for regression to predict the salary based on the input features.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the SVM model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the salary prediction dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
